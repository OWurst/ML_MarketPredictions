The second step of this project is to train some models to predict stock price percent change for a month based on previous stock price percent changes and previous volume data.

## Libaries and Imports:
```{r, imports}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)

source("ModelTrainingFunctions.r")
```
## Training Set Reads
```{r, read_4_month}
month4_df <- read("training_dfs/PriceChangeByPrevious4Months_Training.csv")
head(month4_df)
train_df_4month <- drop_unwanted_pct_data(month4_df)
head(train_df_4month)

```
